# Tutorials and learning

This section contains tutorials that are supposed to help users learn how to use Groundhog. Some of these tutorials are meant to be read by everyone, while some others are focused on those expert Radiance users who will use Groundhog just as a modelling tool.

The order on which they are presented is not necessarily in increasing order.
